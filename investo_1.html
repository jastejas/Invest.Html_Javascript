        <p>Welcome to Investo, your one-stop guide to the world of investing. Whether you're a newbie starting your journey or an expert brushing up on the basics, we've got something for you. Dive in and let's grow your financial knowledge.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Basics Section -->
    <section id="basics" style="display:none;">
        <h2>Investment Basics</h2>
        <p><strong>What is Investing?</strong>: Investing is the process of allocating money or resources with the expectation of generating an income or profit in the future. It's about putting your money to work, so it earns more over time.</p>
        <p><strong>Why Invest?</strong>: Investing can help you achieve various financial goals, such as retirement savings, buying a house, or even financial freedom. The power of compound interest can significantly grow your wealth over time.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Terminology</strong>: Here are some essential terms to get started:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Asset</strong>: Something valuable that an individual, corporation, or country owns with the expectation that it will provide future benefit.</li>
            <li><strong>Bonds</strong>: A debt security that pays interest periodically and returns principal at maturity.</li>
            <li><strong>Equities (Stocks)</strong>: Shares in the ownership of a company that represent a claim on the company's assets and earnings.</li>
            <li><strong>Diversification</strong>: Spreading investments across different types of assets to reduce risk.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The Power of Compound Interest</strong>: Compound interest is when the interest on your investment earns interest itself. Over time, this effect can lead to your money growing exponentially. It's why starting to invest early and consistently can lead to significant returns in the long run.</p>
        <p><strong>Risk and Return</strong>: Every investment comes with a degree of risk. Typically, higher potential returns are associated with higher risk. It's essential to understand and be comfortable with the level of risk you're taking with your investments.</p>

    <!-- Trading Section -->
    <section id="trading" style="display:none;">
        <h2>Trading</h2>
        <p><strong>What is Trading?</strong>: Trading involves buying and selling assets frequently with the aim of making short-term profits. It's different from investing, where the goal is often to buy and hold assets over the long term.</p>
        <p><strong>Difference Between Trading and Investing</strong>: While both involve purchasing assets, trading is often short-term focused, aiming for quick profits. Investing is more about building wealth over time. Traders might make multiple transactions in a day, while investors might hold assets for years or decades.</p>
        <p><strong>Trading Platforms and How They Work</strong>: Trading platforms are software applications that allow investors and traders to place trades and monitor accounts. Examples include brokerage platforms, direct market access platforms, and currency trading platforms.</p>
        <p><strong>Common Trading Strategies</strong>: There are various strategies traders employ, such as day trading (buying and selling assets within the same day) and swing trading (holding assets for several days or weeks to capture price swings).</p>
        <p><strong>Potential Risks and Rewards</strong>: Trading can offer significant profits but also comes with substantial risk. The value of assets can be extremely volatile, and there's a potential for both significant gains and losses.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Inflation Section -->
    <section id="inflation" style="display:none;">
        <h2>Inflation</h2>
        <p><strong>What is Inflation?</strong>: Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services rises, leading to a decrease in purchasing power. In simple terms, as inflation goes up, every dollar you own buys a smaller percentage of a good or service.</p>
        <p><strong>How Inflation Affects Your Money and Investments</strong>: Over time, the purchasing power of money diminishes due to inflation. If your investments are not earning a return that outpaces inflation, you might be losing money in real terms.</p>
        <p><strong>Strategies to Hedge Against Inflation</strong>: There are several ways to protect your investments from inflation: investing in tangible assets like real estate, buying inflation-protected securities, or considering stocks, as businesses can often pass on increased costs to customers.</p>

    <!-- Long-Term vs. Short-Term Investment Section -->
    <section id="long-short" style="display:none;">
        <h2>Long-Term vs. Short-Term Investment</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition and Differences</strong>: Long-term investments are assets that you intend to hold for more than a year, aiming for a significant return over time. Short-term investments are assets held for a year or less, often for immediate returns or to protect capital.</p>
        <p><strong>Advantages and Disadvantages</strong>: Long-term investing can benefit from compound interest, potentially lower taxes, and often involves less risk. Short-term investing offers liquidity and potential for quick profits but may have higher transaction costs and is typically riskier.</p>
        <p><strong>Examples</strong>: Long-term investments might include stocks, real estate, or retirement accounts. Short-term investments can be money market funds, certificates of deposit, or short-term bonds.</p>
        <p><strong>Which is Right for You?</strong>: Consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. If you're saving for retirement, long-term investments might be more suitable. If you're saving for a short-term goal or want to stay liquid, consider short-term investments.</p>
